            Established in 1970, Safina Carpets has its roots in the Mughal era,
            where carpets adorned royal courts and symbolised luxury and
            refinement.
            <br />
            Founded by my grandfather, Sayeed Beg, who handcrafted intricate
            carpets, the tradition grew through the efforts of my father, Sayeed
            Beg, and father, Shahid Beg.
            <br />
            Today, as the fourth generation, I, Rizwan Beg, continue this legacy
            by blending tradition with innovation and bringing it to a global
            audience.
