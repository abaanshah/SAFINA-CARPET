              Established in 1970, Safina Carpets has its roots in the Mughal era,
              where carpets adorned royal courts and symbolized luxury and
              refinement.

              Founded by my grandfather, Sayeed Beg, who handcrafted intricate
              carpets, the tradition grew through the efforts of my father, Sayeed
              Beg, and father, Shahid Beg.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Today, as the fourth generation, I, Rizwan Beg, continue this legacy
              by blending tradition with innovation and bringing it to a global
              audience.
