We offer expedited shipping options for an additional fee. You'll receive tracking information once your order ships, and our delivery team will contact you to schedule a convenient delivery time."

      id: 5,
      question: "Do you offer financing options?",
      answer: "Yes, we partner with several financing companies to offer flexible payment plans. Options include 0% APR for qualified customers, monthly payment plans, and lease-to-own programs. You can apply for financing online or in-store, and approval decisions are typically instant. Minimum purchase amounts may apply."

      id: 6,
      question: "What warranty do you provide?",
      answer: "All our furniture comes with a comprehensive warranty. Solid wood pieces have a 10-year structural warranty, upholstered items have a 5-year frame warranty and 2-year fabric warranty. Hardware and mechanisms are covered for 3 years. We also offer extended warranty options for additional peace of mind."

Our showrooms feature room displays, fabric samples, and knowledgeable staff to assist you. Visit our website for showroom locations, hours, and to schedule design consultations with our experts."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "How do I care for my furniture?",
      answer: "Each piece comes with specific care instructions. Generally, dust regularly with a soft cloth, avoid direct sunlight and heat sources, and use coasters and placemats to protect surfaces. For upholstered items, vacuum regularly and address spills immediately. We also offer professional cleaning and maintenance services."
